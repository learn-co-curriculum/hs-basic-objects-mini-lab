# Build a Basic Object with Readers and Writers

Pick one of the following items and build a class that serves as a blueprint for individual objects created with it. Add at least three readers and writers to the class that will describe instances of the item.

+ Dog
+ Car
+ Baby
+ Pen
+ Foot
+ USB drive
+ Beanbag chair
+ (You choose)

Once this is done, create three instances of the class using `.new` method and add descriptors for each instance using the writer clsses you created.
