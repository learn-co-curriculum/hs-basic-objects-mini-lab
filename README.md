# Build a Basic Object with Readers and Writers
<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/oo-austin-powers.jpg" width="200px" align="right" hspace="10"> Pick one of the following items and build a class that serves as a blueprint for individual objects created with it. Add at least three readers and writers to the class that will read and write attributes for each instance of the class.

+ Dog
+ Sportscar
+ Baby
+ Football player
+ Subway train
+ Pretty much any item of your choice!

Once this is done, create three instances of the class using `.new` method and add attributes for each instance using the writer classes you created.
